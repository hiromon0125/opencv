This is me trying to get computer vision to recognize circles by also filtering with color

Since mac doesn't have a good webcam support I am using a website and taking a screenshot to track a ball on a website
For direction to get the website working go to /svelteStuff/README.md

The actual python programs are in the /cvStuff/computa-vision-sucks.py so have fun
